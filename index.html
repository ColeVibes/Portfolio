        <p>I am a current student and long time fan of coding, and wish to make it my career as a developer in either web, software, or gaming. I originally graduated Culinary School but decided it was no longer for me when looking into a long term life plan. I want to create things with my knowledge and skills, and this page is here to help display those skills! Currently I am working on an updated version of this page so stay tuned!</p>
